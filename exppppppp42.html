    and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.:</p><br>

    The term “Internet of Things” or IoT was first coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999. But it was only when Gartner added IoT to its list of new emerging technologies in 2011, that it started to gain global momentum. As of 2021, there were 21.7 billion active connected devices in the world today,
     out of which more than 11.7 billion (54 percent) are IoT devices. <br>
